### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Hydrologist and an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](iitd.ac.in/). Before this I used to work in [NASA Goddard](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/earth/hydrology/) and [NCAR](https://ncar.github.io/hydrology/). I have a PhD in Water Resources Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. I am primarily interested in developing techniques and systems for forecasting natural hazards such as floods and landslides.

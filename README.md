### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Hydrologist and an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). Before this I used to work in [NASA Goddard](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/earth/hydrology/) and [NCAR](https://ncar.github.io/hydrology/). I received my PhD in Water Resources Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. 

Since 2020, I have started setting up the HydroSense Lab in IITD, dedicated primarily to disaster modeling and mitigation. Currently, we are interested in developing techniques and systems for forecasting natural hazards such as floods, droughts, and landslides. I am recruiting at all levels for our [research group](https://hydrosenselab.github.io/) - Postdocs, PhD, Masters, UG interns. Please email me if you think you are a good fit. 

Most of my programming nowadays happens at [IITD Gitlab](https://git.iitd.ac.in/)
